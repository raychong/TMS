TMS is a simple SQLite with features like
- Add Task
- Edit Task
- Delete Task
- Get Single Task
- Get All Task
- Get Entry Count
in local SQLite database.

AS soon as user launched the app, the app will check for entry count in local database.
If count > 0
 display current records
Else
 display empty state
 
 When user add/edit a task details, app will capture task name and date time to enter into local SQLite database.
